# DropBox Client API Service

This is a .NET-based service that provides a REST API wrapper around Dropbox functionality, allowing for file management operations through HTTP endpoints.

## Project Structure

The solution consists of three main projects:

1. **VideoService** (.NET 9)
   - Main API service project
   - Contains controllers for handling HTTP requests
   - Implements file management endpoints

2. **VideoModels** (.NET 9)
   - Contains data models used across the solution
   - Defines entities like CloudFile and User

3. **VideoBackend** (.NET 9)
   - Core business logic library
   - Implements interfaces for file operations, authentication, and user management
   - Handles Dropbox API integration

## API Endpoints

### Files Controller (`/api/v1/files`)

1. **Get Files**
   - `GET /api/v1/files`
   - Returns a list of all files in the Dropbox account
   - Requires Bearer token authentication

2. **Get Upload URL**
   - `GET /api/v1/files/get-upload-url?fileName={filename}`
   - Generates a pre-signed URL for file upload
   - Requires Bearer token authentication

3. **Delete File**
   - `GET /api/v1/files/delete?fileName={filename}`
   - Deletes a specified file
   - Requires Bearer token authentication

## Authentication

The API uses Bearer token authentication. Include the Dropbox access token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer {your_dropbox_access_token}
```

## Response Models

### CloudFile
```json
{
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "size": "number",
    "pathdisplay": "string",
    "servermodified": "datetime"
}
```

## Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
- 200: Successful operation
- 401: Unauthorized (missing or invalid token)
- 500: Internal server error

## Dependencies

- .NET 9
- Dropbox.Api SDK
- Newtonsoft.Json

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have .NET 9 SDK installed
3. Build the solution
4. Configure your Dropbox API credentials
5. Run the VideoService project

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
